# testing-projects

I'm experimenting with Python to see what I can create. These pieces of code were made with the idea of learning more about Python by putting existing skills into to practice, and to learn new skills as well! Projects in this repository are free and will always be free, and they can be used either for their intended purpose, or as a learning tool!
